// In that file, define a variable named food like this:

// var food = {
//   types: 'only pizza'
// };

// Use console.log() to print the types property of the food object to the terminal.

// Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

var food = {
  types: 'only pizza'
}

console.log(food.types)
